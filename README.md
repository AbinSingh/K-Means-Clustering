# K-Means-Clustering
A Scikit-learn tutorial to predicting MLB wins per season by modeling data to K-Means clustering model and linear regression models.

To analyze sports data. We will import the data from an SQLite database, clean it up, explore aspects of it visually, and engineered several new features. We will learn how to create a K-means clustering model, a couple different Linear Regression models, and how to test your predictions with the mean absolute error metric.
